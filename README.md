🤖 What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems that act as agents—they don't just respond to prompts, but can autonomously make decisions, take actions, and use tools to accomplish tasks. These systems:

Understand user intent and context

Choose and invoke appropriate tools

Follow multi-step reasoning processes

Maintain memory across interactions

✅ Relevance to This Project

It analyzes the user's message and autonomously chooses the correct tool (engine issue, schedule, damage check, etc.)

It maintains conversation history, which helps in understanding follow-ups

It uses LangChain agents to make decisions based on logic, not hardcoded rules

It acts as a virtual service assistant, improving customer experience and reducing manual workload
